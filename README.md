# Churn-Analysis
Customer Churn Analysis Project
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn, a critical metric for businesses to understand and mitigate customer attrition. By examining historical data, we aim to uncover insights into why customers leave and identify strategies to improve retention rates.

Key Steps and Findings
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Conducted thorough data cleaning to ensure data integrity and consistency.
Handled missing values, outliers, and discrepancies in the dataset to prepare it for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Utilized descriptive statistics and visualizations to explore the distribution and relationships within the dataset.
Investigated key metrics such as customer demographics, subscription details, and interaction history.
Cohort Analysis:

Implemented cohort analysis to group customers based on their signup dates.
Analyzed how different cohorts behave over time, particularly in terms of churn rates and retention patterns.
Churn Rate Calculation:

Calculated churn rates across different time periods (monthly, quarterly) to identify trends and fluctuations.
Examined factors contributing to high churn periods and seasonal variations.
Insights Gained
Behavioral Patterns: Discovered behavioral patterns that correlate with higher churn rates, such as usage intensity or customer support interactions.
Segmentation Impact: Identified segments of customers with varying churn behaviors, providing insights for targeted retention strategies.
Predictive Indicators: Highlighted predictive indicators of churn, enabling proactive measures to retain at-risk customers.
Tools and Techniques Used
Data Analysis: Python with Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and cleaning.
Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing trends and distributions.
Statistical Analysis: Cohort analysis techniques and hypothesis testing to validate findings.
